    <h1>What/Who is Floppa?
    <li> Floppa (Russian: Шлёпа) is an internet meme based on a caracal named Gosha (Russian: Гоша), also known as Gregory. Gregory is less preferred, and the meme community uses "Floppa." </li>
    <li> How did this caracal gain popularity?
    <p>Floppa first appeared on the internet on 23rd December 2019 on Instagram. The picture below was uploaded by the user prozhony. It is possible that internet users took a liking to this cat because of its large ears, from which it also gets its name "Big Floppa."
    <li> Members of Gosha's family:
    <p> Owners - Andrey Bondaryev and Yelena Bondaryeva
    <p> Friend, roommate cat - Justin (Russian: Жора, Zhora)
    <li> Floppy's history
    <p> He was born on 21st December 2017 in a caracal breeding facility in Kiev, Ukraine.
    <p> He was transported from Kiev to Moscow by minibus. The journey was very exhausting for the cat.
    <p> Initially, Floppa was not trusting and only contacted the owners for food. Fortunately, he adapted over time.
    <p> In 2020, Gosha underwent surgery to remove a tumor behind his ear, but later recovered.
    <p> In December 2021, Gosha and his owners appeared on Russian state television channel 360.
    <p> After Russia's attack on Ukraine, social media in Russia were banned, but the owners managed to cope with this, likely using a VPN, and continued to publish content.</h1>
